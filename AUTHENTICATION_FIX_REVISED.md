# JWT Authentication Fix - Revised Solution

Based on your continued issues with JWT authentication, I've created a more comprehensive solution to fix the token validation problems. The error message `"invalid JWT: unable to parse or verify signature, token signature is invalid: signature is invalid"` indicates that the tokens being generated by the login endpoint aren't being properly validated when used for other API endpoints.

## Complete Solution Package

I've created several files to help diagnose and fix this issue:

1. **auth_troubleshooter.py** - A specialized script that tests authentication using both direct Supabase API and your backend API
2. **backend/app/enhanced_auth.py** - An enhanced authentication module that supports multiple token types
3. **backend/patch_jwt_auth.py** - A script to update your SECRET_KEY and provide debugging instructions

## Root Causes & Fixes

There are several potential causes for this issue:

### 1. SECRET_KEY Mismatch

When you create a JWT token using one SECRET_KEY and verify it with another, the signature validation will fail.

**Fix:** The patch script updates your .env file with a new secure SECRET_KEY and ensures the same key is used for both token generation and verification.

### 2. Token Type Issues

Your backend might be using a different token format than what's expected by the verification function.

**Fix:** The enhanced_auth.py module provides better support for both custom JWT and Supabase tokens.

### 3. Secret Loading Issues

Environment variables might not be loading correctly.

**Fix:** The updated security.py includes fallback mechanisms to try multiple secret keys.

## Step-by-Step Resolution

1. First, run the JWT patch script:

   ```
   cd backend
   python patch_jwt_auth.py
   ```

2. Restart your FastAPI server:

   ```
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

3. Test with the new authentication troubleshooter:

   ```
   cd ..
   python auth_troubleshooter.py
   ```

4. If issues persist, enable detailed authentication debugging:

   ```
   $env:DEBUG_AUTH = "true"   # PowerShell
   # OR
   set DEBUG_AUTH=true        # CMD
   ```

5. Then restart the server with debug logging:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload --log-level debug
   ```

## Advanced Implementation

For a more robust solution, you can also:

1. Update your main.py file to use the enhanced authentication module:

   ```python
   # Import the enhanced authentication dependency
   from app.enhanced_auth import get_current_user_enhanced

   # Use the enhanced authentication in your routes
   app.include_router(
       projects_supabase_router,
       prefix="/api/projects",
       tags=["projects"],
       dependencies=[Depends(get_current_user_enhanced)]
   )
   ```

2. Consider using Supabase's built-in authentication handling rather than creating custom JWT tokens.

## Testing Your Solution

After implementing the fixes, your document upload functionality should work properly. Use the document_upload_troubleshooter.py script to verify:

```
python document_upload_troubleshooter.py
```

The authentication issues should be resolved, allowing you to successfully upload documents.
