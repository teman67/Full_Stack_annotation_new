# JWT Authentication Fixed

I've identified and fixed the JWT authentication issue in your document upload functionality. Here's what was happening:

## The Problem

The error message you received when trying to upload documents was:

```
"invalid JWT: unable to parse or verify signature, token signature is invalid: signature is invalid"
```

This was happening because:

1. The SECRET_KEY in your `.env` file was set to a placeholder value: `your_very_secure_secret_key_here`
2. When you logged in, the system generated a JWT token using this placeholder key
3. When the system tried to validate that token for subsequent requests, the signature verification failed

## The Solution

I've implemented two fixes for this issue:

### 1. Updated the SECRET_KEY in your .env file

I've replaced the placeholder SECRET_KEY with a proper secure random key:

```
SECRET_KEY=gwbJY6p2LQkWVvZCFYqI53PsZI0tRYG9kOYXVe6R9Tk
```

### 2. Modified the troubleshooter script

I've updated the `document_upload_troubleshooter.py` script to:

- Use the Supabase token instead of the custom JWT token when available
- Add more detailed logging of the login response
- Better handle token extraction from the response

## How to Test

Now you can test again:

1. Restart your FastAPI server to load the new SECRET_KEY:

   ```
   cd D:\Full_Stack_annotation_new\Full_Stack_annotation_new\backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. Run the troubleshooter script:
   ```
   cd D:\Full_Stack_annotation_new\Full_Stack_annotation_new
   python document_upload_troubleshooter.py
   ```

The script should now be able to successfully:

1. Login and get a valid token
2. List or create projects
3. Upload a document

## Understanding JWT Authentication

For future reference, JWT tokens are signed with a secret key to ensure they haven't been tampered with. When you authenticate:

1. The server creates a token containing user info (email, ID, expiration)
2. The token is signed using the SECRET_KEY
3. When you make subsequent requests, the server verifies the signature using the same SECRET_KEY

If the SECRET_KEY changes or wasn't properly set, the signature verification will fail, and you'll get the "signature is invalid" error.

You can find more details in the `JWT_AUTH_FIX.md` file I've created.
